The Ponderosa Habitat is one of the configurations for the [[Ponderosa Inflatable Module|Ponderosa]]. It provides space for your kerbals to hang out after a hard day at work. But more than that, it is a command and control center to manage the operations of your base. If you have the [[kOS Scriptable Autopilot System|http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089-1-0-4-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-v0-17-3-2015-6-27]] installed, then the Ponderosa Habitat will have a kOS terminal installed. This terminal will only be available after you research Precision Engineering.

If you combine Pathfinder with kOS and [[Action Groups Extended|http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195-1-0-4-%28Jul09-15%29-Action-Groups-Extended-250-Action-Groups-in-flight-editing-Now-kOS-RemoteTech]] then you'll be able to assign Action Groups to your converters, lights, generators, and anything else you can think of. Future versions of Pathfinder will have a built-in action group manager in the Ponderosa.

As show below, the Ponderosa has no converters:
