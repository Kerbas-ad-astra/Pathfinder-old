The first power generation option available in Pathfinder, the Poncho Deployable Solar Blanket is a step up from the stock OX-STAT solar panel. While it is equal to ten OX-STAT panels, it costs as much as fifteen of them. But the Poncho has the advantage of reducing the part count for your base for the same amount electrical power generation.

The Poncho must be deployed before it will generate ElectricCharge. To deploy the solar blanket, right-click on the part to bring up its context menu, and press the Deploy button. If you have a kerbal on EVA, make sure that the kerbal stands away from the side marked "Stand Clear" in order to avoid being clobbered by the panel as it deploys.

#Designer's Notes  
The Poncho is Pathfinder's entry-level power generation option, and it came about when I realized that I needed some kind of solar panel for the base, but wasn't ready to create a 2-axial, sun-tracking array. It also gave me the idea of having a power generator at each node along the Electrics path, culminating with the Solar Flare experimental fusion plant.
