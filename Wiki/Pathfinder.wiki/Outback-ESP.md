The Outback is a tiny storage container that holds a small amount of a wide variety of resources. It requires the [Kerbal Inventory System (KIS)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-4-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-2-2) in order to carry it on a kerbal's back. You can radially attach the Outback to your vessel; it does not require an Engineer to do so.
#Usage  
The Outback defaults to a KIS storage container and it doubles the number of slots available to the kerbal. To configure the Outback to store a different resource, simply right-click on the part to bring up its context menu, and press the Next or Prev buttons to change the desired resource. In the VAB/SPH, the Outback will switch to the new resource and fill the container. Out in the field, the backpack will switch to the new resource. If you have resources stored in the container, you will be asked to click the button again to confirm switching. At the top of the context menu is a status field showing you what the Outback currently holds. Even when switching resources, the Outback won't eliminate its store of EVA Propellant. Finally, if you want to show or hide the decals, simply press the Toggle Decals button.

Like the [[Buckboard|MC-100-Buckboard]], the Outback can be converted into a battery by an Engineer. It costs 25 RocketParts to do so, unless you disable the need for RocketParts in the [[Pathfinder Settings|Pathfinder-Settings]] window. Simply right-click on the backpack to open the context menu, and press the Convert to battery button. You can convert it back to storage by pressing the Convert to storage button.
# Designer's Notes  
I originally wanted the Outback to become the basis of its own parts system. Things like a personal grabber unit, attached solar panels, etc. The Outback even has a node on the top of the pack to facilitate attachments. Then I tried actually attaching something to the backpack, and found out that it doesn't follow the kerbal's motions. That made me sad, so now the Outback is just a tiny resource storage pack with some extra EVA Propellant.

It is still useful though. Kottabos noted that it makes a handy emergency battery that can be slapped to the side of a ship that ran out of power. It's also helpful for repairing the TERRAIN Geo Scanner; simply fill the Outback with RocketParts, fly out to the TERRAIN, slap the Outback on its side and transfer the resources. You can use a similar procedure to refill the TERRAIN's cache of ResearchKits. In fact, satellite repair and resupply is why I created the Outback in the first place.
