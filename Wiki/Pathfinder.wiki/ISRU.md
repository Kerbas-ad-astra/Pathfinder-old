Available only in [[Simplified Mode|Simplified-Mode]], the In-Situ Resource Untilization (ISRU) factory is designed to refine Ore into a variety of different resources such as LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, RocketParts, MaterialKits, and Xenon. It is similar to the stock ISRU part, except that the ISRU is heavier and slightly more efficient. Below is the ops view for the ISRU:

As with all converters controlled through the ops view, simply click on the check mark next to the converter to enable it. Each converter shows its current efficiency rating as a percentage enclosed by parenthesis. The following converters are available in the ISRU:
