Available only in Advanced Mode, the Watney Chemistry Lab has several converters that let you make ResearchKits for use in the TERRAIN Geo Scanner and Pathfinder Geology Lab, create Water from MonoPropellant and Oxidizer, or split Water into Oxygen/Oxidizer and LqdHydrogen. The converters are described in detail below.

When you right-click on a Doc configured as a Watney Chemistry Lab, and open the Operations Manager, you'll see the following window:
