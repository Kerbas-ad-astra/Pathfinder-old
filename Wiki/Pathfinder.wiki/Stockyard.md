The Stockyard 250 and Stockyard 375 are designed to oversee construction efforts on new vessels by providing an inflatable space dock. They require the [Extraplanetary Launchpads](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-1-0-4-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-2-90-exp-beware-of-dragons) mod to function properly. In addition to building new vessels, the Stockyards can recycle them by enabling the recycler and flying a vessel into the dock.
