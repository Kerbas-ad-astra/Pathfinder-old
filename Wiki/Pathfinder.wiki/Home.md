# Pathfinder: Geoscience for better resource extraction
You’ve done your resource scanning and looked around some, now comes the time to do some planetary science and site surveys to find the best place to plunk down your refinery and/or more permanent base. Establish a basecamp, stay awhile, and survey the land to see if you can find a better concentration of resources (or not, maybe the original readings weren’t accurate). If you’ve found the right spot, then it’s time to bring in the bigger stuff. If not, then it’s time to pack up and look elsewhere.

**Travel Light**
Pathfinders travel light, and with this mod you’ll have KIS/KAS friendly, portable equipment to go “space camping” with.

**Your Game, Your Choice**
Pathfinder is flexible and easily customizable using ModuleManager patches. Options out of the box include support for Snacks, TAC_LS, Impact, AntennaRange, Remote Tech, and more.

Requires Kerbal Inventory System (KIS) and Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) by KospY & Winn78.
