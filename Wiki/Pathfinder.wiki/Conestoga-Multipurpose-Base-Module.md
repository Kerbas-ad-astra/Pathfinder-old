Designed to help you deploy a small self-contained base, the Conestoga Multipurpose Base Module (MBM) is a rigid container that can hold a wide variety of [[resources|Pathfinder-Resources]] available in Pathfinder. With [Kerbal Inventory System (KIS)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-4-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-2-2) installed, the Conestoga provides storage space for your stuff. Even when configured to store a resource, the Conestoga can hold up to 200 liters of items. It also has a special configuration known as the Bootstrap which contains LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, Equipment, ResearchKits, and MaterialKits. There's just enough resources to help you land the Conestoga with the help of some stock 24-77 "Twitch" motors and set up a pair of Casa modules, all before your crew arrives.

The Conestoga is designed to rest directly on the ground- no bolting to the ground needed. To help you set up a new base, the Conestoga has solar panels, a small amount of ElectricCharge, reaction wheels, SAS, a monopropellant power unit (MPU) and a probe core. It also has attachment points for rover wheels- The Buffalo's M1-A1 Mountain Goat is particularly suited for this role since it also has a decoupler. Once the Conestoga is in the desired location, simply eject the Mountain Goats to drop the module directly onto the ground.
  
The Conestoga can participate in Pathfinder's [[Resource Distribution System|Distributed-Bases]]. When participating, its resources will be evenly distributed to all containers within 2.3km that are also participating in resource distribution, and have the same resources as the Conestoga. 
#Usage  
In the VAB/SPH, you can configure the Conestoga by pressing the Next/Prev buttons to cycle through the available resource configurations. the Conestoga will switch to the new resource and fill the container. After launch, to configure the Conestoga to store a different resource, simply right-click on the part to bring up its context menu, and press the Reconfigure Storage button to bring up the resource configuration screen. Then press the Next or Prev buttons to change the desired resource, and finally, press the Reconfigure button. You'll be asked to press the Reconfigure button again to confirm your new configuration. This will avoid accidentally dumping your resources. Speaking of which, you can dump the resources by right-clicking the part and pressing the Dump Resources button. You'll be asked to press the button again to confirm your decision. Finally, if you want to show or hide the decals, simply press the Toggle Decals button.  
  
# Designer's Notes  
In keeping with Pathfinder's Old West In Space theme, the Conestoga is named after the [Conestoga covered wagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conestoga_wagon). In fact, as much as possible, Pathfinder's storage containers are all named after wagons from the Old West. When I started running out of names, I began naming storage containers after SUVs.
