Similar to [NASA's Multipurpose Logistics Modules,](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/mplm.html) Conestoga Multipurpose Storage Module (MSM) is a rigid container that's designed to hold a wide variety of [[resources|Pathfinder-Resources]] available in Pathfinder. With [Kerbal Inventory System (KIS)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-4-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-2-2) installed, the Conestoga provides storage space for your stuff. Even when configured to store a resource, the Conestoga can hold up to 200 liters of items.

Primarily designed for in-space use, the Conestoga is equipped with RCS thrusters to make it easier to maneuver. It can also be used to transport goods to the surface of a planet or moon.
#Usage  
To configure the Conestoga to store a different resource, simply right-click on the part to bring up its context menu, and press the Next or Prev buttons to change the desired resource. In the VAB/SPH, the Conestoga will switch to the new resource and fill the container. Out in the field, the Conestoga will switch to the new resource. If you have resources stored in the container, you will be asked to click the button again to confirm switching. At the top of the context menu is a status field showing you what the Conestoga currently holds. Finally, if you want to show or hide the decals, simply press the Toggle Decals button.

# Designer's Notes  
In keeping with Pathfinder's Old West In Space theme, the Conestoga is named after the [Conestoga covered wagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conestoga_wagon). In fact, as much as possible, Pathfinder's storage containers are all named after wagons from the Old West. When I started running out of names, I began naming storage containers after SUVs.
