The Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Plant represents Pathfinder's first step into fusion power generation. Think of the Solar Flare as Pathfinder's fusion equivalent of the [EBR-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_Breeder_Reactor_I). The fusion plant generates a whopping 400 ElectricCharge per second via fusion, and burns 0.001 FusionPellets per second (21.6 FusionPellets per day). Unlike the Hot Springs, the Solar Flare's power output doesn't vary upon the base's current planet or moon. However, like its geothermal contemporary, the Solar Flare is also cantankerous and can break down.

Below is the ops window for the Solar Flare:

There are no converters available for the fusion plant, but it does have a custom view:

**Status (1):** This field shows the current status of the fusion plant.  
**Efficiency (2):** This field shows you how efficient the power plant is. The rating is affected by the current biome's efficiency bonus for Metallurgy.  
**Time Until Maintenance (3):** This field shows you how long you have until the next maintenance check. Once time runs out, Pathfinder makes a check to see if the plant can continue to operate. A good result means no change, while a bad result increases the probability that the plant will fail on the next maintenance check. A catastrophic result means that the plant stops operating and needs repairs.  
***  
You'll need 500 RocketParts to effect repairs. Skilled Engineers can reduce that amount. Remember, you can adjust the need for RocketParts in the [[Pathfinder Settings|Pathfinder-Settings]] window, and eliminate the possibility of breakage altogether.

**Failure Probability (4):** This field lists the probability that the Solar Flare will fail on its next maintenance check.  
**Generator Control (5):** Press this button to start or stop the power generation.
# Designer's Notes  
From Electrics to Specialized Electrics, Pathfinder provides a progressive list of power options. At the pinnacle is the Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Reactor. It takes up all of a Hacienda’s space and produces the most ElectricCharge compared to Pathfinder’s other options. Only [Deep Space Exploration Vessel's](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135717-1-0-4-Deep-Space-Exploration-Vessels-1-0-Build-NASA-Inspired-Ships-In-KSP?p=2225231#post2225231) WB-2 Fusion Reactor, available at Experimental Electrics, and DSEV's WB-1 generate more power. Think of the Solar Flare as the precursor to DSEV’s fusion reactors.
