Named after the module itself, the Doc Commercial Science Lab provides similar functionality to the stock Mobile Processing Lab. The Doc is best suited for ground-based operations and isn't particularly good in orbit. Specifically, it provides a 35% bonus to surface operations. But unlike the stock lab, the Doc lets you take your researched Science and convert it to Reputation and Funds.

When you open the ops view, you'll see the following:

While the lab has no converters, it does have a custom view. Press the Show button to display the following view:

**Status Indicators (1):** These indicators show you the current status of the lab. Specifically:  
_Status:_ This shows you the current status of the module.  
_Research:_ This displays the current status of your research efforts.  
_Data:_ This shows you how much scientific data you've accumulated through your experiments, or how much you've used up.  
_Rate:_ This field shows the rate at which your scientists convert data to Science, Reputation, and Funds.  
**Research Values (2):** These fields show you how much Science, Reputation, and Funds you will potentially gain.  
**Transmission Buttons (3):** These buttons will convey the fruits of your labor back to KSC. From left to right, they are: Transmit, Publish, and Sell. Choose wisely, you can only select one of the three options at a time. Once the information arrives back at KSC, you'll receive Science, Reputation, or Funds, respectively, and your Research Values will reset to 0.  
**Button Tool Tip (4):** This field will show what you'll gain for the specific button you've highlighted.  
**Lab Controls (5):** These buttons are duplicated from the Mobile Processing Lab's context menu. They let you clean experiments and start/stop your research activity.
