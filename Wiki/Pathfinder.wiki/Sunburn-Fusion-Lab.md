The Sunburn Fusion Lab is one of the configurations for the [[Doc Science Lab|Doc-Commercial-Science-Lab]]. Its purpose is to create FusionPellets for fusion reactors like the Hacienda's Solar Flare, and the engine and reactors found in the [Deep Space Exploration Vessels](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135717-1-0-4-Deep-Space-Exploration-Vessels-1-0-Build-NASA-Inspired-Ships-In-KSP?p=2225231#post2225231) mod. It also produces Coolant for heat radiators. When you right-click on a Doc configured as a Sunburn, and open the Operations Manager, you'll see the following window:

There are two converters in the Sunburn lab, described below. To enable a converter, simply check the mark next to the converter's name until it glows. Each converter shows its current efficiency rating as a percentage enclosed by parenthesis.

# Coolant  
The Coolant converter produces Coolant for DSEV's heat radiators. It has the following recipe:  
**Inputs**  
_Water:_ 1 units/sec  
_Ore:_ 5 units/sec  
_Minerals:_ 3 units/sec  
_ElectricCharge:_ 30 units/sec  
**Output**  
_Coolant:_ 0.21 unit/sec

# Fusion Pellets  
FusionPellets are used by the Hacienda's Solar Flare experimental fusion reactor as well as DSEV's fusion reactors and fusion engine. It has the following recipe: 
**Inputs**  
_Water:_ 1.75 units/sec  
_Ore:_ 1.75 units/sec  
_Minerals:_ 0.51 units/sec  
_ElectricCharge:_ 30 units/sec  
**Output**  
_FusionPellets:_ 0.21 unit/sec
