Need a light? The Gaslight Telescopic Lamppost has you covered. Simply bolt the lamppost into the ground (remember to drop it onto the ground first before grabbing it again and attaching it to the ground), connect one of its [Kerbal Attachment System (KAS)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29) pipe connectors to a connector on your base, and turn on the lights. The pole will automatically extend before turning the lights on. You can also extend and retract the lamppost as desired.

Unlike stock lights, you can change the color and intensity of the Gaslight out in the field by right-clicking on the part and adjusting the Red, Green, Blue, and Level sliders. Coupled with [[kOS Scriptable Autopilot System|http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089-1-0-4-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-v0-17-3-2015-6-27]], you'll can create some interesting effects... 

More than just a lamppost, the Gaslight serves as a 4-way junction for KAS pipes. This enables you to minimize the number of connectors that you use on your base.  
***  
There is currently an issue with KAS that seems to have trouble with multiple KASModuleStrut objects in the same part, and your pipes can look a bit odd after you reload your base. Hopefully this issue will be resolved in a future update.
***  
Additionally, the Gaslight can serve as a basic antenna, equal to the stock Communotron 16. Its range may vary depending upon whether or not you have Antenna Range installed.
