Larger cousin to the MC-1000, the MC-3000 Buckboard is a storage container that holds a small amount of resources. It has the exact same dimensions as the SC-62 standard storage container found in the [Kerbal Inventory System (KIS)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-4-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-2-2), except that it is twice as long. It can be mounted to the KIS SM-62 mounting rack as well as mounted to the Buffalo Flatbeds. Additionally, you can radially attach a Buckboard to your vessel, and even stack Buckboards on top of each other as well as on top of a Ponderosa.
#Usage  
To configure the Buckboard to store a different resource, simply right-click on the part to bring up its context menu, and press the Next or Prev buttons to change the desired resource. In the VAB/SPH, the Buckboard will switch to the new resource and fill the container. Out in the field, the Buckboard will switch to the new resource. If you have resources stored in the container, you will be asked to click the button again to confirm switching. At the top of the context menu is a status field showing you what the MC-100 currently holds. Finally, if you want to show or hide the decals, simply press the Toggle Decals button.
