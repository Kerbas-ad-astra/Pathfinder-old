**Cost:** 12,000

The Homestead is an expandable module for use in orbit that can be configured for a variety of different uses. In Pathfinder, the Homestead offers industrial configurations such as power generation, production of rocket fuels, creating RocketParts, and 3D printing large components. It benefits from the Pathfinder Geology Lab's Metallurgy research.

# Setup
Unlike the ground elements of Pathfinder, the Homestead cannot be stored in a standard KIS container. Instead, it must be launched into orbit like other crewed modules such as the Hitchhiker. Once in orbit, Press the Deploy button to expand the module to its full diameter.
# Usage
To enter module, you have two options. First, you can click on another module's airlock, select an Astronaut, press the Transfer button, and click on the Homestead. Second, you can EVA an Astronaut and fly next to one of the Homestead's airlocks. At that point, simply grab the ladder and haul yourself aboard.
## Managing Operations
Just like the Ponderosa, the Homestead has an operations manager. Simply right-click on the part to display its context menu, and then click the Manage Operations button to bring up the operations manager. Below is a sample ops view:

**Command and Control (1) -** Press this to display the module's command and control buttons. See below for details.  
**Info (2) -** This view provides a description of the module's current configuration as well as the decal associated with the configuration.  
**Resources (3) -** Press this button to switch to the Resources view. See below for details.  
**Processors (4) -** This view shows the resource converters that are a part of the module, if any. To enable or disable a converter, simply click on the check mark next to the converter's name. See the page on Resource Production for details.  
**Reconfiguration Controls (5) -** These buttons let you reconfigure the module. You can switch between different configurations, preview their descriptions, and determine the resource cost required to reconfigure the module.

**Toggle Decals (1) -** Press this to hide or show the module's decals.  
**Toggle Lights (2) -** Press this to turn on or off the module's lights. Lights consume 0.04 ElectricCharge per second.

**Current Resources**

_The resources panel for the Homestead is the same as for the Ponderosa._

The Resources tab displays the current and maximum resources that the module currently has. The contents of this window vary depending upon the module's current configuration.
## Reconfiguring
If you haven’t changed the settings in Pathfinder’s Settings Window, then you’ll need an Engineer to inflate/deflate the Homestead as well as to reconfigure the module into a different configuration. Inflating the module or changing its configuration requires RocketParts, which represent the equipment and furnishings (cups, computers, desks, etc.) required by the module.  In Standard Mode, it won't cost you any RocketParts to reconfigure.

In addition to reconfiguring the Homestead in the field, you can reconfigure it in the VAB/SPH. Before launch, you can choose any configuration you want, and it won't cost you resources to do so.  

Below is a summary of the Homestead’s configurations. For more information, click on the links provided.

### Brew Works   
Link: [[Brew Works ISRU|Brew-Works-ISRU]]  
The Brew Works provides the ability to convert Ore into LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, and XenonGas. It's slightly more efficient than the stock ISRU converter, but it's larger and heavier.
### Ironworks  
Link: [[Ironworks Foundry|Ironworks-Foundry]]  
The Ironworks produces RocketParts from Metals (or Metal if Extraplanetary Launchpads (EL) is installed), and it can smelt Metals from MetallicOre (or MetalOre with EL installed). With OSE Workshop installed, the Iron Works produces MaterialKits from Ore, and can convert RocketParts to MaterialKits and vice versa.
### Clockworks  
Link: [[Clockworks 3D Print Shop|Clockworks-3D-Print-Shop]]  
With OSE Workshop installed, the Clockworks 3D Workshop gives you a space to build parts. It has more production volume than the blacksmith.
### Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Reactor  
Link: [[Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Plant|Solar-Flare-Fusion-Reactor]]  
The pinnacle of Pathfinder's power generation technologies, the Solar Flare is a large experimental fusion reactor. It generates more power than the Hot Springs and uses FusionPellets.
# Designer's Notes  
I created the original Homestead for my [Contact Lost](www.spellflight.com/ContactLost) website back in December of 2012. It is of course based upon the Transhab from NASA as well as the Bigelow BA330. The first version of the Homestead in KSP became a part of my old Multipurpose Colony Modules mod. It looked different that the current version; I changed the design because I didn't like the look of the module when deflated. If I can figure out how to do vertex animation, the module might change once again.
