The Hacienda is Pathfinder's industrial module. While not needed for prospecting missions, the Hacienda offers industrial configurations such as power generation, production of rocket fuels, creating RocketParts, 3D printing large components, and managing the production of entire vessels. It benefits from the Pathfinder Geology Lab's Metallurgy research. The module is equipped with a special node called ImpactTransform to support drilling modules. Currently, the Hot Springs makes use of this node to support the geothermal tap.

# Setup
As with any other part, simply grab the Hacienda out of your inventory and attach it to an available standard crew port.  
![](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/Hacienda1.jpg)  
Once attached, you can right-click on the part to show its context menu, and press the Inflate button to inflate it.

The first time you inflate a Hacienda, you'll see the following hints window:

# Usage
To enter module, you have two options. First, you can click on another module's airlock, select an Astronaut, press the Transfer button, and click on the Hacienda. Second, you can EVA an Astronaut and walk up next to one of the Hacienda's airlocks.

## Managing Operations
Just like the Ponderosa, the Hacienda has an operations manager. Simply right-click on the part to display its context menu, and then click the Manage Operations button to bring up the operations manager. Below is a sample ops view:

**Command and Control (1) -** Press this to display the module's command and control buttons. See below for details.  
**Info (2) -** This view provides a description of the module's current configuration as well as the decal associated with the configuration.  
**Resources (3) -** Press this button to switch to the Resources view. See below for details.  
**Processors (4) -** This view shows the resource converters that are a part of the module, if any. To enable or disable a converter, simply click on the check mark next to the converter's name. See the page on Resource Production for details.  
**Reconfiguration Controls (5) -** These buttons let you reconfigure the module. You can switch between different configurations, preview their descriptions, and determine the resource cost required to reconfigure the module.

**Toggle Decals (1) -** Press this to hide or show the module's decals.  
**Toggle Lights (2) -** Press this to turn on or off the module's lights. Lights consume 0.04 ElectricCharge per second.

**Current Resources**

_The resources panel for the Hacienda is the same as for the Ponderosa._

The Resources tab displays the current and maximum resources that the module currently has. The contents of this window vary depending upon the module's current configuration.
## Reconfiguring
If you haven’t changed the settings in Pathfinder’s Settings Window, then you’ll need an Engineer to inflate/deflate the Hacienda as well as to reconfigure the module into a different configuration. Inflating the module or changing its configuration requires RocketParts, which represent the equipment and furnishings (cups, computers, desks, etc.) required by the module.  

In addition to reconfiguring the Hacienda in the field, you can reconfigure it in the VAB/SPH. Before launch, you can choose any configuration you want, and it won't cost you resources to do so.  

Below is a summary of the Hacienda’s configurations. For more information, click on the links provided.

### Brew Works   
Link: [[Brew Works ISRU|Brew-Works-ISRU]]  
The Brew Works provides the ability to convert Ore into LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, and Xenon. It's slightly more efficient than the stock ISRU converter, but it's larger and heavier.
### Ironworks  
Link: [[Ironworks Foundry|Ironworks-Foundry]]  
The Ironworks produces RocketParts from Metals (or Metal if Extraplanetary Launchpads (EL) is installed), and it can smelt Metals from MetallicOre (or MetalOre with EL installed). With OSE Workshop installed, the Iron Works produces MaterialKits from Ore, and can convert RocketParts to MaterialKits and vice versa.
### Clockworks  
Link: [[Clockworks 3D Print Shop|Clockworks-3D-Print-Shop]]  
With OSE Workshop installed, the Clockworks 3D Workshop gives you a space to build parts. It has more production volume than the blacksmith.
### Hot Springs Geothermal Plant  
Link: [[Hotsprings Geothermal Plant|Hot-Springs-Geothermal-Plant]]  
The Hot Springs taps into the geothermal energy contained in a planet or moon in order to generate power. Some planets/moons are more geologically active than others, so power output will vary.
### Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Reactor  
Link: [[Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Plant|Solar-Flare-Fusion-Reactor]]  
The pinnacle of Pathfinder's power generation technologies, the Solar Flare is a large experimental fusion reactor. It generates more power than the Hot Springs and uses FusionPellets.
# Designer's Notes  
In order to reinforce the theme of a space western, I've named Pathfinder's parts after names associated with the Old West. Originally, I wanted to use the name Hacienda for a larger version of the Ponderosa. It was supposed to be a permanent structure that's built on site. But when I needed a name for a factory module and did some research on the hacienda, I found out that hacienda were more than estates; they were factories as well! That sealed the deal for me, and the factory module became known as the Hacienda.
