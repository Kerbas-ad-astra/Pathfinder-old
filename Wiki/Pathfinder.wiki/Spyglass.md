The Spyglass Survey Module is designed to oversee construction efforts on new vessels. It requires the [Extraplanetary Launchpads](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-1-0-4-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-2-90-exp-beware-of-dragons) mod to function properly. You'll also need to hammer several survey stakes into the ground to mark your construction area. Consult Extraplanetary Launchpads documentation for details.

#Usage  
The Spyglass can be carried on the back of a kerbal to the desired crew port. To install it, simply grab the Spyglass out of the kerbal's inventory, and drag it over a standard crew port. You'll need an Engineer to install the module properly.
