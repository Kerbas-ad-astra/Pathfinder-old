The Tunnel Extender is designed to put some space between inflatable module airlocks that might be close together. Additionally, it has space to radially attach equipment such as drills and science equipment, and it can seat a Buckboard 1000 if needed. Finally, it has an integrated solar panel to increase your base's power supply.
