The MC-1000 Buckboard is a storage container that holds a small amount of resources. It has the exact same dimensions as the SC-62 standard storage container found in the [Kerbal Inventory System (KIS)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-4-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-2-2). It can be mounted to the KIS SM-62 mounting rack as well as mounted to the Buffalo Flatbeds. Additionally, you can radially attach a Buckboard to your vessel, and even stack Buckboards on top of each other as well as on top of a Ponderosa.
#Usage  
To configure the Buckboard to store a different resource, simply right-click on the part to bring up its context menu, and press the Next or Prev buttons to change the desired resource. In the VAB/SPH, the Buckboard will switch to the new resource and fill the container. Out in the field, right-click the part and press the Reconfigure Storage button. You'll see a window with controls that let you cycle through the various storage options, what resources a storage option holds, and a button to reconfigure the storage unit. At the top of the context menu is a status field showing you what the MC-100 currently holds. Finally, if you want to show or hide the decals, simply press the Toggle Decals button.

The Buckboard can be converted into a battery by an Engineer. It costs 50 RocketParts to do so, unless you disable the need for RocketParts in the [[Pathfinder Settings|Pathfinder-Settings]] window. Simply right-click on the backpack to open the context menu, press the Reconfigure Storage button, and cycle through the options until you find the Battery template.
# Designer's Notes  
When I started planning for Pathfinder, I wanted to at last make RocketParts a requirement to inflate/deflate the Ponderosa and change module configurations. Originally this vision was for Multipurpose Colony Modules, but I never got around to it even though I left hooks in the code. Then I realized that I needed a way to bring RocketParts to the surface. The Conestoga became the transport module, but then I discovered that I needed a way to move the RocketParts from the lander to the base. That's where the Buckboard comes in. And like the Conestoga, the Buckboard is named after a wagon.
