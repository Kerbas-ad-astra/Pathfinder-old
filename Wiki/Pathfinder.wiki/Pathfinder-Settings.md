While Pathfinder has a default play style, it might not match yours. For instance, Pathfinder's modules require RocketParts to inflate and reconfigure, and require specific skills. In additionally, some parts can break down and require RocketParts to repair. That's the default, but with the Pathfinder Settings window, you can change the behavior.

To bring up the Pathfinder Settings window, find the Pathfinder button on the application menu toolbar. You will find this button at the Space Center and in the Flight screen.

After pressing the Pathfinder button, you'll see the following window:

For each option, If the check mark by the option is growing green, then it means that the option is enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled. The following options can be configured:

## Require resources to reconfigure modules  
If this option is checked, then you will need to have sufficient RocketParts to reconfigure modules such as the Ponderosa, Doc Science Lab, and Hacienda. You'll also need RocketParts to change what resource a drill will extract, to convert the Buckboard and Outback into batteries, and to configure a Chuckwagon as a greenhouse. Since storage containers like the Buckboard, Chuckwagon, Conestoga, and Wagon don't require resources to change what they store, they ignore this option's setting.
## Require skill check to reconfigure modules  
If this option is checked, then you will need an appropriately skilled kerbal to reconfigure the part. For instance, the Ponderosa and Hacienda both require an Engineer to reconfigure, as do drills. Similarly, reconfiguring the Doc Science Lab and converting a Chuckwagon into a greenhouse both require a Scientist. Without this option checked, anybody can reconfigure the part.
## Repairs Require Resources  
Some parts, such as the power generators and TERRAIN resource scanner can break down. if they do, then you'll need to EVA a kerbal to effect repairs. When you repair the part, this option, if checked, signifies that it will take RocketParts to repair.
## Parts can break  
Similarly, if checked, then parts can break down. You can prevent that from happening by unchecking this option.  
#Pathfinder Settings (Space Center Menu)  
At the Space Center, the Pathfinder Settings menu has an additional option: Play Mode.

Pressing the Play Mode button will display the following menu:

This menu is pretty self-explanatory. On the left are controls for selecting a Play Mode, and on the right is a description of the Play Mode and what the default settings will be in the Pathfinder window. Once you've selected a Play Mode, simply press the OK button and restart Kerbal Space Program. For more information about Play Modes, click here.  
# Designer's Notes  
Now that Pathfinder has Play Modes, does that mean it will have support for MKS? The short answer is No. The long answer is that MKS uses a different set of code modules and a different resource production chain than Pathfinder, effectively meaning that having a MKS Play Mode available in the Pathfinder mod would require me to support _two_ mods. That's something that is beyond my desired workload. Sure, someone else could create the Play Mode on my behalf and have it included in the mod, but then I'd be obligated to maintain the Play Mode and keep it current with the latest MKS. Again, that is beyond my desired workload. But Pathfinder is based on the idea that it's your game and your choice. So if you want to create a Play Mode and distribute it independently of the Pathfinder mod, knock yourself out. :)
