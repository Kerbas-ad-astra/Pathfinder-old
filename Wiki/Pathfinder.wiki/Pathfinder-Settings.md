While Pathfinder has a default play style, it might not match yours. For instance, Pathfinder's modules require RocketParts to inflate and reconfigure, and require specific skills. In additionally, some parts can break down and require RocketParts to repair. That's the default, but with the Pathfinder Settings window, you can change the behavior.

To bring up the Pathfinder Settings window, press the Mod key and P key simultaneously. The Mod key varies based upon operating system and game configuration, but on Windows, the Mod key defaults to Alt. You can similarly close the window by pressing Mod P again. After pressing Mod P, you'll see the following window

For each option, If the check mark by the option is growing green, then it means that the option is enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled. The following options can be configured:

## Require resources to reconfigure modules  
If this option is checked, then you will need to have sufficient RocketParts to reconfigure modules such as the Ponderosa, Doc Science Lab, and Hacienda. You'll also need RocketParts to change what resource a drill will extract, to convert the Buckboard and Outback into batteries, and to configure a Chuckwagon as a greenhouse. Since storage containers like the Buckboard, Chuckwagon, Conestoga, and Wagon don't require resources to change what they store, they ignore this option's setting.
## Require skill check to reconfigure modules  
If this option is checked, then you will need an appropriately skilled kerbal to reconfigure the part. For instance, the Ponderosa and Hacienda both require an Engineer to reconfigure, as do drills. Similarly, reconfiguring the Doc Science Lab and converting a Chuckwagon into a greenhouse both require a Scientist. Without this option checked, anybody can reconfigure the part.
## Repairs Require Resources  
Some parts, such as the power generators and TERRAIN resource scanner can break down. if they do, then you'll need to EVA a kerbal to effect repairs. When you repair the part, this option, if checked, signifies that it will take RocketParts to repair.
## Parts can break  
Similarly, if checked, then parts can break down. You can prevent that from happening by unchecking this option.
