The Ponderosa is a containerized inflatable module that serves as a foundation for your temporary bases. It has three standard crew transfer ports that enable you to attach other inflatable modules such as the Chuckwagon, Doc Science Lab, and Hacienda. Like all inflatable base modules in Pathfinder, the Ponderosa can be configured for a variety of different uses. Specifically, it houses all Habitation related templates. The Ponderosa can be stored inside a standard KIS container.

# Usage
## Mounting Points
As a containerized module, the Ponderosa can fit the Kerbal Inventory System (KIS) SM-62 standard mounting rack. It can also be mounted to the Buffalo’s flatbed, and can be stacked vertically with other Ponderosas as well as Buckboard storage containers. Most importantly, the Ponderosa can be mounted to a Saddle Muncrete Slab, which is required to build your temporary base. Anybody can mount the Ponderosa to an SM-62 mounting rack, Buffalo flatbed, or to another Ponderosa or Buckboard.

## Setup
When setting up a new base, it’s important to properly attach a Saddle to the ground before assembling the base’s components. The following shows you how to properly set up your base so that it won’t suffer disastrous results when reloaded by the game. Here's how:  
### Grab A Saddle  
Grab a saddle from your inventory.

### Drop Saddle On Ground  
Next, drop the Saddle onto the ground.

### Attach Saddle To Ground  
Finally, grab the Saddle by pressing the G key, place and orient it as desired, and then press X to attach the Saddle to the ground.

## Managing Operations
Ponderosas have a lot of functionality associated with them, and they’re organized via the Ponderosa Operations Manager (POM). Simply right-click on a Ponderosa to bring up its context menu and press the Manage Operations button to open the POM.
***  
**Ponderosa Operations**  
![](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/POM1.jpg)  
**Command and Control (1) -** Press this to display the module's command and control buttons. See below for details.  
**Info (2) -** This view provides a description of the module's current configuration as well as the decal associated with the configuration.  
**Resources (3) -** Press this button to switch to the Resources view. See below for details.  
**Processors (4) -** This view shows the resource converters that are a part of the module, if any. To enable or disable a converter, simply click on the check mark next to the converter's name. See the page on Resource Production for details.  
**Reconfiguration Controls (5) -** These buttons let you reconfigure the module. You can switch between different configurations, preview their descriptions, and determine the resource cost required to reconfigure the module.  
***  
**Command and Control**  
![](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/POM2.jpg)  
**Control From Here (1) -** Same as any "Control From Here" button that all command pods have.  
**Rename Base (2) -** Press this to bring up the standard vessel renaming window.  
**Toggle Decals (3) -** Press this to hide or show the module's decals.  
**Toggle Lights (4) -** Press this to turn on or off the module's lights. Lights consume 0.04 ElectricCharge per second.  
**Current Configuration's Custom View (5) -** Press this to show or hide the custom controls associated with a specific configuration. This button might not be available if the configuration doesn't have a custom view.  
***  
**Current Resources**  
![](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/POM3.jpg)  
The Resources tab displays the current and maximum resources that the module currently has. The contents of this window vary depending upon the module's current configuration.
## Reconfiguring
If you haven’t changed the settings in Pathfinder’s Settings Window, then you’ll need an Engineer to inflate/deflate the Ponderosa as well as to reconfigure the module into a different configuration. Inflating the module or changing its configuration requires RocketParts, which represent the equipment and furnishings (cups, computers, desks, etc.) required by the module.  
***  
_Don't want to haul a bunch of RocketParts around to inflate and reconfigure your modules? Do you want everybody to be able to reconfigure and inflate them? Change them! Simply press and hold the modifier key (which defaults to Alt on Windows) and P key simultaneously to bring up the [[Pathfinder Settings|Pathfinder-Settings]] window. Then uncheck the requirements for RocketParts and Engineers._  
***  
In addition to reconfiguring the Ponderosa in the field, you can reconfigure it in the VAB/SPH. Before launch, you can choose any configuration you want, and it won't cost you resources to do so.

## Pathfinder Geology Lab  
Link: [[Pathfinder Geology Lab|Pathfinder-Geology-Lab]]  
The cornerstone of Pathfinder, the Geology Lab enables you to perform geological research in the current biome to: unlock resource extraction and enable you to take core samples via the Gold Digger; analyze core sample and/or geology reports to improve Habitation, Science, and Industry resource converter efficiencies; generate geology reports for use in efficiency analyses; uplink with T.E.R.R.A.I.N. equipped satellites to monitor their status; and finally, analyze seismic data from vessel impacts on the planet/moon’s surface (requires the Impact mod).
## Blacksmith OSE Workshop
Link: [[Blacksmith|Blacksmith-OSE-Workshop]]
With the OSE Workshop mod installed, the Blacksmith enables you to 3D print parts such as hammers, screw drivers, and even an entire Ponderosa with sufficient resources.
## Ponderosa habitat  
Link: [[Ponderosa Habitat|Ponderosa-Habitat]]  
The Habitat is more than just a place for your kerbals to hang out. It also serves as the command and control center for your base. If you have the kOS mod installed, for instance, the Ponderosa Habitat comes equipped with a computer terminal.
## Pigpen Recycler  
Link: [[Pigpen Recycler|Pigpen-Recycler]]  
If you have a life support mod installed such as Snacks or TAC-LS, then the Pigpen is useful for recycling the waste products produced by the life support systems.
# Designer’s Notes
The Ponderosa has undergone a few revisions since its days in the Multipurpose Colony Modules mod. For one, I changed the container to be the same size as the KIS SM-62. Once I realized that I’d need some kind of transportation for Pathfinder, I added a stack node on top of the container to enable vertical stacking.
Just how do you fit all the equipment and furnishings into the Ponderosa when you inflate or reconfigure it? I’m sure a lot can fit through the airlock door, but there’s also a seam in the dome that lets you fit bulky items inside before you seal it up and inflate the module. It all happens off camera of course. RocketParts is really an abstraction of all the stuff that goes inside, and while it might not be realistic, I take a plausible deniability approach to the laws of physics if doing so improves game play.
