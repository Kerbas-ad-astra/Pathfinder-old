While Pathfinder offers a plethora of converters and configuration templates, sometimes you might want a simplified play experience. With Pathfinder, you can switch to Simplified Mode by opening the Pathfinder Settings window in the Space Center, changing the Play Mode, and restarting the game. Your existing bases will be reset to the simplified set of available templates.  
While in Simplified Mode, the number of resources you need for your production chains is reduced as is the available configuration templates. Specifically:  
##Ponderosa/Casa  
You have access to the [[Ponderosa Habitat|Ponderosa-Habitat]], [Pathfinder Geology Lab|Pathfinder-Geology-Lab]], [[Blacksmith|Blacksmith-OSE-Workshop]] (if OSE Workshop is installed), and [[Pigpen Recycler|Pigpen-Recycler]] (if you have a life support mod installed). For the Geology Lab, you don't have access to the efficiency improvements while in Simplified Mode.  
##Doc Science Lab  
In Simplified Mode, only the [[Doc Science lab|Doc-Science-Lab-Configuration]] is available.  
##Hacienda  
The Hacienda receives a big change in Simplified Mode. Its templates are replaced by the [[ISRU|ISRU]] and the [[Power Plant|Power-Plant]].  
##Buckboards, Conestoga, Buffalo storage bins and Chuckwagon  
For your convenience, the storage containers are unaffected by Simplified Mode.
