The Ironworks Foundry is designed to produce RocketParts. How it does so depends upon what mods are installed. See below for details. It can also produce other resources if OSE Workshop is installed. The Ironworks benefits from Metallurgy research from the [[Pathfinder Geology Lab|Pathfinder-geology-lab]]. Below is the ops view for the Ironworks:
