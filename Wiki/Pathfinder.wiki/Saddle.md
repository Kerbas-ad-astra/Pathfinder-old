Not just a foundation module for Pathfinder, the Saddle is _the_ foundation module. Without a Saddle, your base is likely to experience the Kraken as it loads into the scene and jumps unexpectedly into the sky. As a result, it is important to bolt the Saddle properly into the ground. See below for details.

After bolting a Saddle into the ground, it's save to attach base elements to it such as the [[Ponderosa|Ponderosa]] and [[Switchback|Switchback]]. It takes an Engineer to attach the base element; simply grab the module out of your inventory, and drag it over the Saddle.

In addition to being the foundation for your base, the Saddle has two KAS pipes for connecting vessels together. These work just like any other KAS pipe, so see the [Kerbal Attachment System](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29) for details.

## Setup
When setting up a new base, it’s important to properly attach a Saddle to the ground before assembling the base’s components. The following shows you how to properly set up your base so that it won’t suffer disastrous results when reloaded by the game. Here's how:  
### Grab A Saddle  
Grab a saddle from your inventory.
