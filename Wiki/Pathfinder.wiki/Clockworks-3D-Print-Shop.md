The larger cousin to the [[Blacksmith|Blacksmith-OSE-Workshop]], the Clockworks is one of the configurations for the [[Hacienda Inflatable Factory|Hacienda]]. It is only available if you have the [[OSE Workshop|http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-1-0-2-OSE-Workshop-MKS-KIS-Addon-%28v0-7-3-2015-06-01%29]] mod installed. With OSE Workshop, you'll be able to 3D print the parts that you find in the VAB and SPH using either MaterialKits or RocketParts up to a maximum of 10,000 liters. But unlike the Blacksmith, the Clockworks can produce MaterialKits.

Below is the ops window for the Clockworks:

As with all converters controlled through the ops view, simply click on the check mark next to the converter to enable it. Each converter shows its current efficiency rating as a percentage enclosed by parenthesis.  

The Clockworks has the following converter:
# Make MaterialKits

**Inputs**  
_Ore:_ 0.5 units/sec
