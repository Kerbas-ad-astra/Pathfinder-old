The larger cousin to the [[Blacksmith|Blacksmith-OSE-Workshop]], the Clockworks is one of the configurations for the [[Hacienda Inflatable Factory|Hacienda]]. It is only available if you have the [[OSE Workshop|http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-1-0-2-OSE-Workshop-MKS-KIS-Addon-%28v0-7-3-2015-06-01%29]] mod installed. With OSE Workshop, you'll be able to 3D print the parts that you find in the VAB and SPH using MaterialKits. Some parts will require ExoticMinerals and RareMetals as well. You can print parts with a volume up to a maximum of 14,500 liters. But unlike the Blacksmith, the Clockworks can produce MaterialKits, and can sift through dirt to find rare metals and exotic minerals.

Below is the ops window for the Clockworks:

As with all converters controlled through the ops view, simply click on the check mark next to the converter to enable it. Each converter shows its current efficiency rating as a percentage enclosed by parenthesis.  

The Clockworks has the following converters:
# Make MaterialKits  
This converter produces MaterialKits from Ore. It has the following recipe:  
**Inputs**  
_Ore:_ 1 units/sec  
_ElectricCharge:_ 5 units/sec  
**Output**  
_MaterialKits:_ 0.375 units/sec 
# Prospecting  
This converter produces sifts through Dirt to find valuable resources. It has the following recipe:  
**Inputs**  
_Dirt:_ 1 units/sec  
_ElectricCharge:_ 5 units/sec  
**Output**  
_RareMetals:_ 0.02 units/sec  
_ExoticMinerals:_ 0.02 units/sec  
# Managing The Workshop  
The Clockworks has the same controls as the Blacksmith:
