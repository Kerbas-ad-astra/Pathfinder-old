**Conversion Cost:** 600 Equipment  
**Nominal Growing Time:** 540 (90 days)  
**Nominal Crop Yield:** Varies. In general, one crop yield will support 3 kerbals for 90 days
**Specialist Skill:** Scientist  
**Specialist Bonus:** Growing time reduced up to 50%, crop yield increased up to 50%  

The Prairie (a.k.a. P.O.T.A.T.O.) greenhouse is one of the configurations for the Chuckwagon. It is only available if you have a life support mod installed such as Snacks, TAC-LS, and USI-LS. The greenhouse is designed to consume resources continuously but grow crops over time. In general it takes 90 days to grow crops, but that time can be reduced by a skilled scientist.  

As in the real world, crops can fail. Once the growing time completes, Pathfinder will check to see if you receive a partial yield, full yield, improved yield, or failed yield. A partial yield reduces the amount of crops you receive, and a failed yield means that you receive no crops at all. By contrast, a full yield gives you the nominal amount and an improved yield gives you more.  

The resources consumed varies depending upon the life support mod installed:
# Snacks  
With Snacks installed, the Prairie uses the following recipe:  
**Inputs**  
_Water:_ 0.002 units/sec  
_Fertilizer:_ 0.002 units/sec  
_ElectricCharge:_ 6 units/sec  
**Required**  
_Dirt:_ 400 units  

# TAC-LS  
With TAC Life Support installed, the Prairie uses the following recipe:  
**Inputs**  
_CarbonDioxide:_ 0.00014 units/sec  
_Water:_ 0.00000357 units/sec  
_Fertilizer:_ 0.000001 unit/sec   
_ElectricCharge:_ 7 units/sec  
**Output**  
_WasteWater:_ 0.000001 units/sec  
_Oxygen:_ 0.000115 units/sec  
**Required**  
_Dirt:_ 705 units  

#USI-LS  
With USI-LS installed, the Prairie uses the following recipe:  
**Inputs**  
_Water:_ 0.0002 units/sec  
_Fertilizer:_ 0.0002 unit/sec  
_ElectricCharge:_ 6 units/sec  
**Required**  
_Dirt:_ 400 units
