Pathfinder's storage parts, such as the Buckboard, Chuckwagon, Conestoga, and Outback as well as Buffalo's Wagon and Chassis, can all hold a wide variety of different resources. While Pathfinder has resources that are specific to the mod, all storage containers created by Wild Blue Industries can hold all the common resources provided by Wild Blue Tools as well as resources provided by mods like Pathfinder. Thus, [Deep Space Exploration Vessel's](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135717-1-0-4-Deep-Space-Exploration-Vessels-1-0-Build-NASA-Inspired-Ships-In-KSP?p=2225231#post2225231) storage tanks can hold resources defined by Pathfinder, and vice-versa. Listed below are the resources that are specific to Pathfinder:

In addition to Pathfinder-specific resources, Pathfinder's storage containers can also contain the common resources provided by Wild Blue Tools:

# Designer's Notes  
The idea of having universal storage containers began with Multipurpose Colony Modules as an effort to reduce part count in the parts catalog. At the time, I didn't know that Firespitter, which has the ability to switch resources, existed. Oh well... I carried the idea forward to DSEV when I created the FLM-1800 storage tank that fitted inside the Hex Truss. I realized that I could share resources across mods if I standardized the templates. And since the FLM-1800 held 5,600 liters of volume, all of my universal storage containers have capacities calibrated to fractions or multiples of 5,600 liters. Of course now the 1.875m DSEV tanks are integrated into the hex trusses, but the idea of storing multiple resources has carried through to all the storage tanks in my various mods.
