**Mass:** 0.25t (unconfigured. Configured mass varies)  
**Crew Capacity:** 4  
**Cost:** 8,000  
**Research:** Space Exploration  
**Unlock Cost:** 18,000  
**Impact Tolerance:** 15 m/sec  
**Max Temp:** 900 K  
**Stored Volume:** 1,100 L  

The Casa is the radially attached version of the [[Ponderosa Inflatable Module|Ponderosa]] that serves as a foundation for your temporary bases. It has three standard crew transfer ports that enable you to attach other inflatable modules such as the Chuckwagon, Doc Science Lab, and of course other Casa modules. Like all inflatable base modules in Pathfinder, the Casa can be configured for a variety of different uses. Specifically, it houses all Habitation related templates. The Casa can be stored inside a standard KIS container.
  
The Casa can participate in Pathfinder's [[Resource Distribution System|Distributed-Bases]]. When participating, its resources will be evenly distributed to all containers within 2.3km that are also participating in resource distribution, and have the same resources as the Casa.
# Usage
The Casa is radially attached just like other base modules; simply grab a Casa from your inventory, walk to an available crew port, and drag the Casa onto the crew port. It takes an Engineer to attach a Casa to a crew port.

## Managing Operations
Casas have a lot of functionality associated with them, and they’re organized via the Casa Operations Manager (COM). Simply right-click on a Casa to bring up its context menu and press the Manage Operations button to open the COM.

**Casa Operations**

**Command and Control (1) -** Press this to display the module's command and control buttons. See below for details.  
**Info (2) -** This view provides a description of the module's current configuration as well as the decal associated with the configuration.  
**Resources (3) -** Press this button to switch to the Resources view. See below for details.  
**Processors (4) -** This view shows the resource converters that are a part of the module, if any. To enable or disable a converter, simply click on the check mark next to the converter's name. See the page on Resource Production for details.  
**Reconfiguration Controls (5) -** These buttons let you reconfigure the module. You can switch between different configurations, preview their descriptions, and determine the resource cost required to reconfigure the module.  
***  
**Command and Control**  
![](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/POM2.jpg)  
**Control From Here (1) -** Same as any "Control From Here" button that all command pods have.  
**Rename Base (2) -** Press this to bring up the standard vessel renaming window.  
**Toggle Decals (3) -** Press this to hide or show the module's decals.  
**Toggle Lights (4) -** Press this to turn on or off the module's lights. Lights consume 0.04 ElectricCharge per second.  
**Current Configuration's Custom View (5) -** Press this to show or hide the custom controls associated with a specific configuration. This button might not be available if the configuration doesn't have a custom view.  
***  
**Current Resources**  
![](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/POM3.jpg)  
The Resources tab displays the current and maximum resources that the module currently has. The contents of this window vary depending upon the module's current configuration.
## Reconfiguring
If you haven’t changed the settings in Pathfinder’s Settings Window, then you’ll need an Engineer to inflate/deflate the Casa as well as to reconfigure the module into a different configuration. Inflating the module or changing its configuration requires Equipment, which represent the equipment and furnishings (cups, computers, desks, etc.) required by the module.  
***  
_Don't want to haul a bunch of Equipment around to inflate and reconfigure your modules? Do you want everybody to be able to reconfigure and inflate them? Change them! Simply press Pathfinder button on the application toolbar to bring up the [[Pathfinder Settings|Pathfinder-Settings]] window. Then uncheck the requirements for Equipment and Engineers._

***  
In addition to reconfiguring the Casa in the field, you can reconfigure it in the VAB/SPH. Before launch, you can choose any configuration you want, and it won't cost you resources to do so.  
Below is a summary of the Casa’s configurations. For more information, click on the links provided
## Pathfinder Geology Lab  
Link: [[Pathfinder Geology Lab|Pathfinder-Geology-Lab]]  
The cornerstone of Pathfinder, the Geology Lab enables you to perform geological research in the current biome to: unlock resource extraction and enable you to take core samples via the Gold Digger; analyze core sample and/or geology reports to improve Habitation, Science, and Industry resource converter efficiencies; generate geology reports for use in efficiency analyses; uplink with T.E.R.R.A.I.N. equipped satellites to monitor their status; and finally, analyze seismic data from vessel impacts on the planet/moon’s surface (requires the Impact mod).
## Blacksmith OSE Workshop
Link: [[Blacksmith|Blacksmith-OSE-Workshop]]
With the OSE Workshop mod installed, the Blacksmith enables you to 3D print parts such as hammers, screw drivers, and even an entire Ponderosa with sufficient resources.
## Ponderosa habitat  
Link: [[Ponderosa Habitat|Ponderosa-Habitat]]  
The Habitat is more than just a place for your kerbals to hang out. It also serves as the command and control center for your base. If you have the kOS mod installed, for instance, the Ponderosa Habitat comes equipped with a computer terminal.
## Pigpen Recycler  
Link: [[Pigpen Recycler|Pigpen-Recycler]]  
If you have a life support mod installed such as Snacks or TAC-LS, then the Pigpen is useful for recycling the waste products produced by the life support systems.  
***  
_NOTE: The Pigpen is only available if you have a life support mod installed such as Snacks, TAC-LS, or USI-LS._

# Designer’s Notes
Originally I wanted the Ponderosa to be radially attached, but I couldn't figure out how to make the airlocks work. Now that I've solved that problem, I went ahead and created the Casa. Some people prefer the Ponderosa, others prefer the Casa, so I kept both of them. You can anchor your base using a single Saddle and either a single Ponderosa or a single Switchback 4-way hub. Either way works. :)
