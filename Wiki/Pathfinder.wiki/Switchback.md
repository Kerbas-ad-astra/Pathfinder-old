The Switchback is a 4-way hub module designed to provide radial attachment points for a variety of different modules. It is equipped with a solar panel that generates 0.7 ElectricCharge per second, and it has a small amount of Kerbal Inventory System storage. The Switchback also has a KAS pipe for attaching pipes to. It can be carried on the back of a kerbal.

To use the Switchback, simply drop it onto the ground- no ground attachment required, but you can bolt it to the ground for additional stability. Be sure to drop it on the ground so that the integrated stand rests on the ground and the solar panels are pointing skyward.  

#Designer's Notes  
I tried making an inflatable 4-way hub but so far I haven't come up with something that meets my requirements for crew port height that also looks good. So the Switchback is a compromise; I assume that off-camera, the Switchback is assembled after being pulled from storage.
