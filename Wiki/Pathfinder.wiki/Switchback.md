The Switchback is a 4-way hub module designed to provide radial attachment points for a variety of different modules. It is equipped with a solar panel that generates 0.7 ElectricCharge per second, and it has a small amount of Kerbal Inventory System storage. It can be carried on the back of a kerbal.

To use the Switchback, bolt a [[Saddle|Saddle]] to the ground and then attach the Switchback to the Saddle. You'll need an Engineer to complete the procedure.

#Designer's Notes  
I tried making an inflatable 4-way hub but so far I haven't come up with something that meets my requirements for crew port height that also bolts into the ground and looks good. So the Switchback is a compromise; I assume that off-camera, the Switchback is assembled after being pulled from storage.
