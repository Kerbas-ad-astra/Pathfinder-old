---REVISION HISTORY---

0.7.6: The Last of the Mohicans - Elk Hunt

This release brings with it some bug fixes (thanks ozraven!) as well as a new part: the Poncho! Think of buying 10 OX-STAT panels and gluing them together, except that they fold out and cost as much as 15 OX-STAT panels. It won't track the sun, but the Poncho will provide a lot of power for your fledgling base. The Sombrero circular solar array is still planned...

New Part
- Added the Poncho, a large folding solar array that cannot track the sun. But hey, you can mount it on the Buckboard, Ponderosa, Saddle, and SM-62.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the drill switcher would show an empty window if the biome hasn't been unlocked yet.

Special thanks to ozraven:
- Fixes for reconfigure affordability check.
- Deflating discards resources that cannot be stored.
- Entire vessel's crew now searched for skill modifier calculation.
- Updated inflate/deflate logic to account for deflate confirmation.

0.7.5 The Last of the Mohicans

This update brings the last of Pathfinder's core base modules. Specifically, it updates the Chuckwagon and it adds optional life support templates that will appear if you have a life support mod installed. Pathfinder supports TAC Life Support (the gold standard of life support), and Snacks out of the box. Other life support options are possible; just read up on how to edit a template file on the wiki. You may also want to check out the MM_TACLS.cfg and MM_Snacks.cfg files for examples. Additionally, you can now generate power using the Hot Springs Geothermal Plant. Keep in mind that it's maintennance intensive, a bit finicky, and not 100% efficient on all worlds. You also have the Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Plant and it's also a bit ornery. Together the Hot Springs and Solar Flare represent the upper end of Pathfinder's power options- lower-tier options are in the works. Finaly, the Ponderosa Habitat is now more than just a placeholder... if you have kOS installed.

Chuckwagon
- You can now science the kraken out of the Chuckwagon and convert it into a greenhouse.
- Added front and side attachment points.
- Added temporary IVA. IVAs are on backorder.
- Added airlocks.

Templates
- You can now retool the Blacksmith to use RocketParts instead of MaterialKits, just like the Clockworks.
- More than just a habitat module, the Ponderosa template is also used as a command and control center. The template now provides support for kOS if you have that mod installed and if you've researched Precision Engineering. kOS is great for creating power management scripts; it works best with Action Groups Extended.
- Added the Pigpen Recycler to the Ponderosa. With a life support mod, it has some useful recyclers.
- The Geology Lab now shows the current efficiency improvements for Science, Industry, and Habitation- based resource processors for the current biome.
- Added the Hot Springs Geothermal Plant to the Hacienda. Hot Springs generates lots of power but it is maintennance intensive and can break down. Don't want it to break? No problem, just use the Settings window to make parts unbreakable. It's available after you've researched High-Powered Electrics.
- Added the Solar Flare Experimental Fusion Plant. It's available after you've researched Specialized Electrics. Like the Hot Springs, it too can break down or be set to unbreakable in the Settings window.
- Did a balance pass on the templates. Some weigh less and need less RocketParts than before, others are more expensive. Skilled Engineers give discounts to inflate/reconfigure modules.

ModuleManager Patches
- Relocated the MetallicOre, Metals, and Ironworks MM patches for Extraplanetary Launchpad to a central file called MM_ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.cfg. This will make it easier to modify Pathfinder to support other production chains than the EL standard MetalOre->Metal->RocketParts.
- Added MM_TACLS.cfg and MM_Snacks.cfg patches to configure Pathfinder to use TACLifeSupport or Snacks, respectively.
- Added MM_CommercialSciLab.txt, an optional MM patch that will enable the Doc Commercial Science Lab's lab functionality on all parts with lab modules. Simply rename MM_CommercialSciLab.txt to MM_CommercialSciLab.cfg if you want to enable this functionality.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the module info window would not properly show the template decal.
- Lights should now properly turn themselves off when deflating a part.
- You won't be able to turn on the lights when a module is deflated.
- Resource converter efficiencies are now being calculated properly.
- Fixed an issue where converting storage to a battery was reporting incorrect values.
- If you stack a box of RocketParts onto a Ponderosa and try to inflate it, the Ponderosa will now properly check to make sure it has enough parts.
- Drills will now remember the correct resource that you switched them to.

0.7.0: The Magificent Seven
youtube: Magnificent Seven Theme

NOTE: Please pack up your base before applying this update, there were a lot of changes under the hood.
NOTE: Please be sure to update your OSEWorkshop to the very latest version.

For science! The Gold Digger generates experiment results while taking core samples. Those results are now worth more than just their Science value; you can use them to improve the efficiency of your habitation, science, and industry processors. In other words, creating RocketParts, MaterialKits, ResearchKits, Water, and others will be improved if you have good results when performing your soil analysis, metallurgic analysis, or chemical analysis in the Geology Lab. And with the Geology Lab’s new Biome Analysis, you can either use the research to improve your production abilities within the biome, or transfer the data to the new Doc Commercial Science Lab. It will cost you Science to perform a Biome Analysis, but you stand to gain much more.

New Parts
- Added the Doc Commercial Science Lab. This is a new multipurpose laboratory. With the Doc Commercial Science Lab, developed in partnership with the Rasta Engineering Group (thanks rasta013 for the lab configs!), you get a Mobile Processing Lab equivalent that can do more than just process experiments for Science over time; you can publish the research for Reputation, or sell the research for Funds. You can also reconfigure the lab into the Sunburn pellet lab, and produce FusionPellets and Coolant for your fusion needs. And finally, you can retool it into the Watney Chemistry Lab, named after a fictional character that finds creative survival solutions through chemistry.

- Added the Hacienda Inflatable Multipurpose Factory. The Hacienda meets your industrial needs by providing the Ironworks, where you can smelt Metals from MetallicOre and create RocketParts from Metals. If you have Extraplanetary Launchpads installed, then you'll also get the Fireworks Survey Station, where you can build vessels. Also you smelt Metal from MetalOre, and fabricate RocketParts from Metal instead of using MetallicOre and Metals. Be sure to bring some survey stakes and a mallet. And if you have OSE Workshop installed, then you'll get the Clockworks, which lets you 3D print parts in larger volumes than the Blacksmith, and you can retool the printers to use RocketParts instead of MaterialKits (or vice versa). Additionally, with OSE Workshop installed, the Ironworks lets you produce MaterialKits, and convert between MaterialKits and RocketParts.

Saddle
- Updated config file to reflect the latest KIS.

Storage Templates
- Added templates for Metals and MetallicOre. These will turn into Metal and MetalOre with Extraplanetary Launchpads installed.

Ponderosa & Buckboard
- Now you can stack the Ponderosa and Buckboard on top of each other via convienient stacking nodes.

Ponderosa Templates

- Geology Lab: Added the ability to generate a Biome Analysis. Be sure to carefully read the tooltip.
- The Geology Lab can use core samples to perform a soil analysis, metallurgic analysis, or chemical analysis. A Soil analysis improves production efficiency for life support (coming soon!), a metallurgic analysis improves fabrication processors (Ironworks), and a chemical analysis improves chemical processors (Watney lab, Sunburn lab).
- When unlocking a biome for the first time and generating Science in the process, the Geology Lab will use the stock experiment results dialog to display the fruits of your labor.
- The Geology Lab can uplink to an orbiting T.E.R.R.A.I.N. equipped satellite/station to check on its status and switch to the vessel as desired.

TERRAIN
- Added a "Review Data" button to review the Science collected by the TERRAIN. It will display the stock experiment results dialog.
- Added some feedback fields to the right-click menu.

Gaslight, Ponderosa, Chuckwagon
- Added ability to toggle the lights via Lights action group.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where you'd see "No need to reconfigure to the same module type" when switching templates.
- Fixed an issue with the Gold Digger's ability to know which tech node activates its ability to drill for resources.
- Fixed an issue preventing the Blacksmith from printing parts. (NOTE: You'll need the latest version of OSEWorkshop as well)

Recommended Mods
Extraplanetary Launchpads: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-1-0-4-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-2-1

0.1.6: Neon Light

Need a light? The Gaslight Telescopic Lamppost has you covered. Plant it in the ground (if you can run into it and move it, it’s not planted properly), extend the pole, and turn on the lights. It has a small battery built in, but for continual use, be sure to plug it into your base using its built-in KAS ports. It even serves as a short-range omnidirectional antenna- thanks for the suggestion, MeCripp, hope you like the MC-16 communications link. :) Don’t like the color? Are the lights too bright? You can change them in the field through the light’s right-click menu. 

This update supports the OSE Workshop as a new template for the Ponderosa, and adds a new MaterialKits storage template as well. OSEWorkshop lets you 3D print individual parts like hammers, the Mk1 command pod, and even another Ponderosa. If you download OSE Workshop (I recommended the mod), you’ll be able to 3D print parts if you have enough MaterialKits.

In keeping with the mod's spirit of jurry-rigging what you need, you can now re-engineer the Buckboard and Outback into batteries. This is a revision to the battery template added last update. Additionally, you can now reconfigure drills to drill for different resources. You'll see this concept of jurry-rigging in other parts in the future.

Finally, there are some bug fixes, infrastructure changes, and integrated standard KAS ports to help keep your base’s part count down.

NOTE: Please retire your existing TERRAIN scanners (unless you're savy enough to open your save file and replace PhotoSupplies with ResearchKits).

New Parts
- Added the Gaslight Telescopic Lamppost. It comes with a 4-way KAS pipe junction.

Saddle
- Added a pair of integrated KAS pipes.

Outback
- If attached to a command pod that can hold crew, the Outback will have the ability to recharge its EVA Propellant.

Templates
- Added the Blacksmith 3D Print Shop template to the Ponderosa. This will only be available if you have OSE Workshop installed (I recommend the mod).
- Added a new storage template to hold MaterialKits.
- Renamed PhotoSupplies to ResearchKits, and changed the icon.
- Changed the icon for the Ponderosa Habitat.
- The Battery template's EC levels have been nerfed; The Outback holds 154EC, while the Buckboard holds 611EC (comparable to a stack of three Z-200 batteries). Additionally, you'll need RocketParts and an Engineer to convert the Outback/Buckboard into batteries (which of course can be turned off using the Settings window). To convert the Buckboard/Outback into a battery, right-click the part to open the action menu, and press the "Convert to battery" button. You can convert the Buckboard/Outback back into a storage container as well.

Other
- Created a wiki page describing how to add a template to the Ponderosa: https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/Anatomy-Of-A-Template

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the Buckboard would incorrectly show a ToggleAnimation button during EVA.

0.1.5: Bonanza

Orbiting satellites are great for detecting resources from space, but advanced sensors take a long time to research. With this update, Pathfinder introduces resource scanning tech earlier in the game- assuming it works. Additionally, the Geology Lab can do things that the stock surface scanner can- and more if you staff it right. Finally, the new Outback gives you a handy way to haul small amounts of resources around without lugging the Buckboard.

New Parts
- Added the T.E.R.R.A.I.N. Geo Scanner. If it breaks down, you'll have to repair it. Don't want it to break? You can change it in the settings menu. 
- Added the Outback Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP). It's great for hauling a small amount of resources around, and it's EVA friendly. It can be attached to the exterior of a vessel by pressing the "H" key, and detached using the "G" key. Anybody can use it.

Ponderosa
- Cleaned up the Ponderosa right-click menu and moved a lot of functionality to the Ponderosa Operations window. Access it via the Manage Operations button in the right-click menu.

Pathfinder Geology Lab
- The Geology Lab is now controlled through the Operations window. Simply right-click on the Ponderosa, press the Manage Operations button, and press the Show button to manage the Geology Lab.
- The Geology Lab can now perform a surface analysis of the biome if properly staffed.
- If you have the Impact mod (I recommend it), the Geology Lab can lend its seismometer to the cause if properly staffed.

Templates
- Added the Prime Flux Battery template to the Buckboard and Outback, named after Prime Flux, who suggested the idea. Thanks Prime Flux! :)

ToolTips & Settings
- Added a tooltip to remind players that the requirement to pay for redecorating/inflating the Ponderosa can be turned off.
- The Settings window can now be toggled using the modifier key (which defaults to the Alt key on Windows) plus P instead of being hard coded to the Alt key.

Resources & Storage
- Added the PhotoMaterials resource for taking pictures.
- Adjusted the Buckboard's storage capacity when not being used to store KIS items.
- You can now access the Chuckwagon's inventory from inside the module.

KIS/KAS
- Updated the saddle to account for the latest changes in KIS.
- Thanks to the latest version of KIS, non-engineers can attach the drill to a vessel with the "H" key and grab it with the "G" key.

0.1.4: Raw Hide

Developer Notes: When I started working on Multipurpose Colony Modules, I always intended to have the player spend resources to reconfigure the module. Its successor, Pathfinder, finally realizes that vision. Similarly, certain templates require a specific skill to reconfigure the module into its new configuration.

The new requirements add a new challenge to the gameplay without overly complicating the system. But as always, it’s your game, your choice, so you can disable these requirements if you prefer not to play with them. Simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder settings window, and uncheck the box next to “requires resources to reconfigure.” If you uncheck the box, the Ponderosa won’t require resources to inflate and outfit the module either. Similarly, you can disable the skill requirement.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The directory structure has changed. Please delete the WildBlueIndustries folder before installing this update.
NOTE: Please pack up your Ponderosas before applying this patch.

- The Ponderosa now requires RocketParts to inflate the module and to reconfigure it. Be sure to have an ample supply of RocketParts on your vessel. If you prefer to not use this feature, simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder Settings window to disable it.
- Added the Conestoga Multipurpose Logistics Module (MLM). The Conestoga holds a lot more stuff than the Buckboard, but it’s not very hand-portable.
- Added the Mineshaft Portable Crew Tube (PCT). Mount one on each Ponderosa that you want to connect to, and then link them together, just like the KAS pipe.
- Added the Ponderosa Habitat template to the Ponderosa. It will be helpful in the future, but right now it's decorative.

0.1.3: Dead Or Alive

NOTE: Please pack up your base before applying this patch.
- Adjusted the Buckboard storage capacity to something more reasonable and carryable.
- Removed attach_node from the Saddle; I think that's causing the Kraken to take notice.
- You can now access the Ponderosa's inventory from inside the module as well as during EVA.

0.1.1: Blaze Of Glory

Want to camp out? Then take along the Ponderosa Inflatable Crew Module (ICM)! First bolt a Saddle into the ground, then saddle up the Ponderosa. The ICM comes outfitted with the Pathfinder Geology Lab, but other configurations are possible. And if you need supplies, don't forget to bring along the Buckboard shipping container.

- Added the Saddle Mini-Slab. Attach this to the ground.
- Added the Ponderosa Inflatable Crew Module with Pathfinder Geology Lab.
- Added the MC-1000 Buckboard, a container able to hold a variety of different resources.

0.1.0: Save My Soul

NOTE: This is a technology demo As such, parts and functionality are subject to change.

Do you have what it takes to be a prospector? Then step right up and try your luck with the Gold Digger Portable Mini-Drill! Take core samples for science! Analyze the results! Don't eat the samples.

- Introducing the Gold Digger Portable Mini-Drill.
