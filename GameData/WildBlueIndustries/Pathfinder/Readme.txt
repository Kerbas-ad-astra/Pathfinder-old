---REVISION HISTORY---

0.1.4: Raw Hide

Developer Notes: When I started working on Multipurpose Colony Modules, I always intended to have the player spend resources to reconfigure the module. Its successor, Pathfinder, finally realizes that vision. Similarly, certain templates require a specific skill to reconfigure the module into its new configuration.

The new requirements add a new challenge to the gameplay without overly complicating the system. But as always, it’s your game, your choice, so you can disable these requirements if you prefer not to play with them. Simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder settings window, and uncheck the box next to “requires resources to reconfigure.” If you uncheck the box, the Ponderosa won’t require resources to inflate and outfit the module either. Similarly, you can disable the skill requirement.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The directory structure has changed. Please delete the WildBlueIndustries folder before installing this update.
NOTE: Please pack up your Ponderosas before applying this patch.

- The Ponderosa now requires RocketParts to inflate the module and to reconfigure it. Be sure to have an ample supply of RocketParts on your vessel. If you prefer to not use this feature, simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder Settings window to disable it.
- Added the Conestoga Multipurpose Logistics Module (MLM). The Conestoga holds a lot more stuff than the Buckboard, but it’s not very hand-portable.
- Added the Mineshaft Portable Crew Tube (PCT). Mount one on each Ponderosa that you want to connect to, and then link them together, just like the KAS pipe.
- Added the Ponderosa Habitat template to the Ponderosa. It will be helpful in the future, but right now it's decorative.

0.1.3: Dead Or Alive

NOTE: Please pack up your base before applying this patch.
- Adjusted the Buckboard storage capacity to something more reasonable and carryable.
- Removed attach_node from the Saddle; I think that's causing the Kraken to take notice.
- You can now access the Ponderosa's inventory from inside the module as well as during EVA.

0.1.1: Blaze Of Glory

Want to camp out? Then take along the Ponderosa Inflatable Crew Module (ICM)! First bolt a Saddle into the ground, then saddle up the Ponderosa. The ICM comes outfitted with the Pathfinder Geology Lab, but other configurations are possible. And if you need supplies, don't forget to bring along the Buckboard shipping container.

- Added the Saddle Mini-Slab. Attach this to the ground.
- Added the Ponderosa Inflatable Crew Module with Pathfinder Geology Lab.
- Added the MC-1000 Buckboard, a container able to hold a variety of different resources.
