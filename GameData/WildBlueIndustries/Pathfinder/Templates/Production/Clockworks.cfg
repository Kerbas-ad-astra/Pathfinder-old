	description = The Clockworks 3D Print Shop is the larger and more advanced cousin to the Blacksmith. In addition to having a 3D printer with five times the volume 	of the Blacksmith, you can create MaterialKits and even sift through Dirt to find ExoticMinerals and RareMetals. The Clockworks also comes equipped with a recycling unit to recycle stored items back to MaterialKits with a conversion rate of 45%.
